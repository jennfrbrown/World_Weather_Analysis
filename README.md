# World_Weather_Analysis
## Deliverable 1
Generates a set of 2,000 random latitudes and longitudes, retrieves the nearest city, and performs an API call with the OpenWeatherMap. In addition to the city weather data gathered in this module,  API skills are used to retrieve the current weather description for each city. Then,  a new DataFrame containing the updated weather data is created.
